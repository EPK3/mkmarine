        <p class="box">We live in civilized times that offer few opportunities for true, raw adventure, and few people have the means and the temperament to pursue the “astounding” in a world that often settles for the mediocre. Children who begin their lives with dreams of traveling through space or searching for historic treasures all too often find that as adults their dreams have been downsized and squeezed into conformity.</p>
